# ðŸ“„ HealthAI Documentation

This is the documentation site for the HealthAI iOS app.

The app has two main tabs:
- ðŸ¤– AI Chat: A chatbot that gives you quick insights about your health.
- ðŸ“Š Charts: A place to see your health data (steps, sleep, heart rate, and more) in simple graphs.

Everything is displayed clearly and cleanly. This site explains the app's features, the challenges behind making it, and ideas for what could come next.
