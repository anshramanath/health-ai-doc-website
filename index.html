  <h2>Architecture Overview</h2>
  <p>
    This SwiftUI app features a chatbot that uses Apple HealthKit data 
    (steps, heart rate, energy, exercise, sleep) as context to answer health 
    questions using the DeepCoder 14B LLM via OpenRouter. A separate tab 
    displays clean charts with toggles to switch between metrics and weekly/monthly views.
  </p>

  <h2>Challenges & Solutions</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Configuring Info.plist</strong>: Spent an hour trying to find the file... just for a 2-minute youtube video to call me stupid in 4 different languages</li>
    <li><strong>Swift & SwiftUI Basics</strong>: Learned concepts like struct, enum, and view files on the fly through youtube videos and chatgpt (lightwork)</li>
    <li><strong>Foundation vs. SwiftUI</strong>: Was confused on the difference between the two imports - realized a pattern and documentation confirmed it</li>
    <li><strong>Finding the Right LLM</strong>: I wanted a free LLM API (cuz why does everything cost money) so I searched until I landed on DeepCoder 14B which is free and reliable</li>
    <li><strong>Prompt Engineering</strong>: Wasn't getting the LLM responses I wanted until I designed prompts that included system behavior and health summaries</li>
    <li><strong>Chart Design</strong>: On the month toggle, was struggling to make the chart look nice and readable - performed a lot of trial and error changing up chart settings until I got it to look right</li>
    <li><strong>App Layout</strong>: Initially didn't understand how to configure the app - setting up an entry point and tabs - until I asked chatgpt to put everything into react terms (@main is like index.js)</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Future Improvements</h2>
  <p>
    With more time, I‚Äôd expand the app by adding more tabs and features to make 
    it feel more complete. I‚Äôd also make insights proactive with notifications - 
    ‚ÄúBro get up and go for a walk!.‚Äù I‚Äôd explore using a more 
    advanced model with refined prompt engineering for smarter responses. Lastly, 
    adding metric summaries and a CSV export option would improve usability and let 
    users track their health data outside the app.
